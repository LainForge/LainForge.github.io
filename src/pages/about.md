#### And rest is history as they say!

Currently Lainforge is a team of over **8 people** working across **4 different projects.**

If you have a new project idea or want to just contribute to the existing ones, you should hangout with us in our [discord](https://discord.gg/UxGdN56meC) channel.  

We are looking out for similar minded people on internet who like to `code for fun`
