  It's that time of the year again! Put on your contributor hats cause we're going on an open source adventure.

We're reaching the end of another year... Is it just me or do you also feel as if the this year has passed even faster than the last year. To put things in perspective here are some important events that happened this year so far - 

- Earlier this year GPT-4 and Starship were launched and one of them is actually still working <3
- The Titanic's spectral residents welcomed some new companions.
- Elton John ended his touring career (finally)

and... ðŸ¤” 
Yeah that's pretty much all of the important events. Anyway, October is here and it's about time for the second biggest event of this year (after GPT-4 launch) - `HacktoberFest`

### What is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)?

Well it's a month long event hosted by Digital Ocean and GitHub where you can contribute to open source projects and earn some cool swag.
It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a pro, you will find something to contribute to.

So the way this works is that you have to make 4 pull requests to any open source project on GitHub and you'll get a limited edition Hacktoberfest t-shirt and some stickers.

### The catch

Ok so this year Hacktoberfest turns 10 and to celebrate this milestone they have made some changes to the rules.
Changes are that **you won't get a t-shirt** 

Read more about this... [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/)

### What's the point of participating if I don't get a t-shirt?

So over the last decade participants use to pick the easiest projects to contribute to and make 4 pull requests and get a t-shirt. This was a good thing because it encouraged people to contribute to open source projects but it also had a downside.

The biggest downside was that there was no real learning involved. People would just pick any random project and make a pull request and get a t-shirt. 

Very few people were motivated enough to choose good projects and make meaningful contributions.

So now that there is no t-shirt involved the only **sensible** reason to participate in Hacktoberfest is to get some experience in open source development which you can then write about on your resume. 

In hindsight this is actually a good thing as it might help you land a new job in the future.

### What's the best strategy for participating this year?

So this year you need a different strategy to participate in Hacktoberfest if you want to get the most out of it.
   
My advice would be to take your time and decide your tech stack, area of interest and then find a project that you like and then make a pull request.

This way you'll get to learn a lot more and you'll also get to know the maintainers of the project and you might even get a chance to work with them in the future.

I have collected some resources that might help you get started with your journey.

### Resources

You can search for projects based on the programming language you want to work with or the area of interest you have by using the following [link](https://hacktoberfest-projects.vercel.app/)

And if you're looking projects based on the difficulty level then you can check out the following list that I have compiled.

#### Level 1 Projects

If you are an absolute beginner and you don't know where to start then you can check out these projects. These generally involve making some changes to the documentation of the project or write just a few lines of code.

The goal of these projects is to get you familiar with the process of making a pull request and get you comfortable with the GitHub workflow.

#### Level 2 Projects

If you have some experience with open source development and you want to contribute to a project that is used by a lot of people then you can check out these projects.

The goal of these projects is to teach you how to work with a team and how to make meaningful contributions to a project.
