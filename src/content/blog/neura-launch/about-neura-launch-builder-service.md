# The Builder Service

## PROLOGUE

In this blog, we will explore the Builder Service, a service that is a part of the larger project called NeuraLaunch. NeuraLaunch is an open source organisation that simplifies the deployment of machine learning models. In our previous blogs we have spoken about the project architecture and the cli tool. In this blog, we will focus on the functionalities of the Builder Service, specifically the three endpoints that comprise it:

- `/downloadFiles`
- `/verifyChecksum`
- `/buildDockerImage`

## Introduction: The Builder Service

The Builder Service plays a crucial role in the NeuraLaunch ecosystem. It is heart of the project that facilitates you with the APIs for your model. Its primary responsibility is to handle the downloading of files from the S3 bucket and perform necessary verifications to ensure data integrity and security.

Neura Launch is a platform that takes care of the complex task of deploying machine learning models, providing users with a hassle-free experience. With the Neura Launch CLI tool and library, users can quickly deploy their models without worrying about the technical intricacies.

### The `/downloadFiles` endpoint

One of the key features of the Builder Service is the `/downloadFiles` endpoint. This endpoint allows users to retrieve the necessary files from the S3 bucket. By providing the required parameters, users can easily access the files they need for their machine learning projects.

When using the `/downloadFiles` endpoint, users can specify the files they need for their specific project. The Builder Service handles the process of fetching these files from the S3 bucket and making them available for download. This eliminates the need for users to manually search for and download the files themselves.

### The `/verifyChecksum` endpoint

To ensure the integrity of the downloaded files, the Builder Service offers the `/verifyChecksum` endpoint. Users are required to provide the checksum of the files from their local system, and the Builder Service calculates its own checksum for comparison. This process guarantees that the downloaded files have not been tampered with or corrupted during the transfer.

The `/verifyChecksum` endpoint provides an added layer of security and confidence in the downloaded files. By comparing the user-provided checksum with the one calculated by the Builder Service, any discrepancies or potential tampering can be detected.

### The `/buildDockerImage` endpoint

After successfully downloading and verifying the files, the Builder Service takes the process a step further by providing the `/buildDockerImage` endpoint. This endpoint allows users to build a standardised Docker image for the web application of their final machine learning model. By simplifying the deployment process, users can focus on their core tasks without worrying about the complexities of containerization.

The `/buildDockerImage` endpoint automates the process of creating a Docker image for the final machine learning model web application. This standardised image ensures consistency and ease of deployment across different environments. By abstracting away the complexities of containerization, the Builder Service enables developers to focus on their machine learning models and application logic.

## Conclusion

The Builder Service plays a vital role in the Neura Launch project, enabling users to effortlessly download files, verify their integrity, and build Docker images for their machine learning web applications. With the help of the Builder Service, developers can streamline their deployment process and focus on delivering exceptional machine learning solutions.
